    "post" : "I'm almost positive Trump isn't a robot. Why? Because Trump is too erratic to be a robot. Unless the tech people are lying about their progress of AI, Trump is a mortal. Firstly, we know Trump was once a child. This is proof that The Donald was indeed born normally. He's been around an awfully long time too, and he's been in the public eye for decades. He has children, and that also rules out the possibility that he's a robot. Also, AI can't feel anything, and we know that Trump has very strong feelings toward people he sees as triggers, like Rosy O'Donnell or Kristen Stewart. He often goes off-script, which shouldn't happen, as Trump should be programmed recite the speech verbatim. Clearly, he's not a robot, unless he's an AI experiment gone haywire.",

    "post" : "The 28-time Olympic medalist was racing as part of the Discovery Channel’s Shark Week. To avoid a celebrity being eaten on live television, the shark was computer-generated, with its time based on the speed of its real-life counterparts through the water. Because humans struggle to reach speeds of more than 5.5mph in the water, while sharks can easily reach 25mph, Phelps was given a little help. He was outfitted with a wetsuit to reduce drag and a monofin as a stand-in for a shark’s hugely powerful tail.",

It was the scandal with the Leader of The Free World's largest son bringing the smoldering for months scandal to a new phase.

If nothing else, their confected nonsense is the ultimate distraction for a distracted society, a cash-grab for a materialistic age, a deep groan of all of us who know we should ignore it but who will still reach for the remote regardless.",

After the American College of Physicians said that gun violence was a public health issue, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch said there were plenty of other dangerous items such as cigarettes and feet.",

    "post" : "Supporters of President Donald Trump are willing to bend over backward to believe all kinds of conspiracy theories. The latest conspiracy promoted by Alex Jones, host of “InfoWars,” is about the California wildfires. Even though California officials say the fires were exacerbated by climate change and a five-year drought, Jones blamed them on former President Barack Obama and his reptilian alien allies. That is not the only conspiracy theory being promoted about the California fires. Alt-right site Breitbart promoted the racist lie that the fires were started by an undocumented Mexican immigrant. Breitbart also claimed that Gonzalez had been arrested for his role in starting the wildfires. But this claim was angrily refuted by local police.  ICE also got involved and accused Sonoma County of being “uncooperative” and taking actions that left their community vulnerable to dangerous individuals and preventable crimes.",
